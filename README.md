# Student Evaluation Login 

# UI using React


A UI that allows students to evaluate their courses. A login form is provided to allow the students to login, a comments form to allow the students to enter their comments, and the Thank You form. The login form accepts the student’s email address and password.

The comments form automatically populates the email field with the student’s email value entered in the login form and allows the student to enter the course code, course name, and comments. Two other fields are present in this form that will be different for each student. For example, fields for a favorite topic, favorite assignment, strongest technical skill obtained in this course, etc. The Thank You form thanks the user for providing the comments.
